			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hello! My name is Skyler and I am a 14 year old, Front-End Web
				Developer. I began my whole journey about three years ago when
				my best friend suggested I start coding. He was doing Web
				Development at the time, so I decided to do it as well! I
				started getting tips from him as well as watching some YouTube
				videos to get me started. I slowly grew as a young Web Developer
				and started to get the hang of it. Fast forwarding to the
				present day, I now know HTML and CSS, but I am still in the
				process of learning JS.
